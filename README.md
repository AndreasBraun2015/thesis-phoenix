# Thesis

Thesis is an Elixir/Phoenix hex package for quickly and easily adding content
editing to any page.

It's inspired by the [Rails gem](https://github.com/infinitered/thesis-rails) by
the same name and author.

## Installation and Configuration

_If you are having problems, view `README_INSTALL.md` for manual instructions._

#### 1. Add thesis to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:thesis, "~> 0.0.14"}]
end

def application do
  [applications: [:thesis]]
end
```

#### 2. Run `mix thesis.install`

This install script will add Thesis to your `config.exs` and `web.ex`, as well
as generate a migration and an authorization module in `lib/thesis_auth.ex`.

#### 3. Add the Thesis editor to your layout

```eex
  <body>
    <%= thesis_editor(@conn) %>
```

#### 4. Run `mix ecto.migrate`

```
$ mix ecto.migrate
```

## Making Pages Editable

Use the `Thesis.View.content/4` view helper function to make a content area
editable. If you added `use Thesis.View` in your `web.ex` file, this function
is already available on all of your views.

Thesis will add a wrapper `<div>` around editable HTML and plain-text content
areas.

### Rich Text Areas

Simply wrap your HTML in a `content` function call.

```eex
<h1>Title</h1>
<p>
  Here's my default description!
</p>
```

becomes...

```eex
<%= content(@conn, "Section identifier", :html) do %>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>
    Here's my default description!
  </p>
<% end %>
```

### Plain Text Areas

For plain-text, provide a `do:` option for default text.

```eex
<h1>My Title</h1>
```

becomes...

```eex
<h1><%= content(@conn, "Title identifier", :text, do: "My Title") %></h1>
```

### Global Content Areas

Content areas in Thesis are page-specific. However, if you want an editable
region that can be displayed on multiple pages, use the
`Thesis.View.global_content/4` function. Internally, the page_id will be set
to `nil` to indicate it applies globally, rather than to a specific page.

```eex
<%= global_content(@conn, "Footer Text", :html) do %>
  <h4>Contact Info</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Call us at (800) 555-1212</li>
    <li>Email us at hello@example.com.</li>
  </ul>
<% end %>
```

### Meta Title and Description

In your layout, you can output the current title and description like so:

```eex
<title><%= page_title(@conn, "Default Title") %></title>
<meta name="description" content="<%= page_description(@conn, "Default Description") %>" />
```

Some prefer to set the page title and description in their controller actions:

```eex
def about(conn, params) do
  @title = Thesis.View.page_title(conn, "About My Company")
  @description = Thesis.View.page_description(conn, "A relevant description here.")
end

```

## Authorization

You probably don't want your website editable by the world. Thesis doesn't
force you to use any particular authorization strategy.

Instead, Thesis will call your auth module's `page_is_editable?/1` function
and provide the current `conn`, which can be used to extract current user
session data as well as the current page, and then you can decide how that
should affect authorization.

Here's an example which we use on our own website, [https://infinite.red](https://infinite.red):

```elixir
defmodule IrWebsite.ThesisAuth do
  def page_is_editable?(conn) do
    IrWebsite.AuthController.logged_in?(conn)
  end
end
```

In our `auth_controller.ex` file, the `logged_in?/1` function looks something
like this:

```elixir
  def logged_in?(conn) do
    !!current_user(conn)
  end

  def current_user(conn) do
    get_session(conn, :current_user)
  end
```

So, in this case, we're simply checking to see if the user has been logged in
or not. Since only Infinite Red employees have logins, it's safe for us to
assume that if they're logged in, they have permission to edit the page.

## What Thesis Isn't

You can't have it all. Thesis isn't the same as other -bloated- full-function
content management systems out there. This is a list of what it's not now and
not likely to be in the future.

_We reserve the right to change our mind, however. :-)_

* Not a WordPress Replacement
* Not a full featured CMS
* Not a full featured WYSIWYG editor
* Not an authentication or permission system
* Not supported outside of a Phoenix app

## Contributing

We're committed to making Thesis the go-to content editing system for Phoenix
websites. Please help us improve!
